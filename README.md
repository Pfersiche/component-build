# component-build

a visual component for a tech bootcamp banner ad

I'm building out the html framework for the page, inputting the required text.
I feel like I'm using up my 6 possible h tags very fast.. i'm thinking i should maybe have a few as h3 but just with different classes for css? okay I'm trying that. I'd got so used to using className, I did that by accident to start with. I'm just trying to colour and arrange as many items as possible
